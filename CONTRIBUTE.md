# Contributing to Kinectron

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Kinectron! Now that we've released version 1.0.0, we welcome contributions to help improve and expand the project.

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for developers who want to modify and contribute to the Kinectron codebase. If you're looking for instructions on how to use the built application and client API, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Project Architecture

Kinectron consists of two main components:

1. **Application (`app/`)**: An Electron-based desktop application that interfaces with the Azure Kinect hardware and broadcasts data over WebRTC
2. **Client API (`client/`)**: A JavaScript library that connects to the Kinectron server and provides methods for accessing different data streams

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. [Azure Kinect SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/sensor-sdk-download) (for application development)
4. [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (for application development)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository to your account, and then clone it to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBHANDLE/kinectron.git
cd kinectron
```

2. Install dependencies for the root project:

```bash
npm install
```

## Client API Development

You can develop the client-side API from Mac or PC.

### Project Structure

The Kinectron client consists of:

- **src/**: Modern ES module source files for the client library
- **examples/**: Example applications and testing interfaces
  - **streamTest/**: Stream testing interface with visualization tools
  - **test/**: Simple connection testing interface
- **dist/**: Build output directory (generated by Parcel)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

2. Make changes to the source files in `client/src/`:

   - `kinectron-modern.js`: Main client API
   - `peer/`: Peer connection code
   - `streams/`: Stream handlers
   - `utils/`: Utility functions

3. Build the library with your changes:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a bundled version of the client library in the `client/dist` directory.

### Development Workflow

#### Running the Stream Test

To run the stream test interface:

```bash
npm run test:stream
```

This will:

1. Clean the Parcel cache and dist directory
2. Build the client library from src/index.js
3. Start a development server with the streamTest example
4. Open the page in your default browser

#### Building the Client Library

To build the client library:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

1. Clean the Parcel cache and dist directory
2. Build the client library from src/index.js
3. Output the result to the dist directory

#### Continuous Development

If you'd like to make several changes over time, Parcel can watch your files for changes and automatically rebuild:

```bash
npm start
```

Use Ctrl+C to stop this process.

### Known Issues and Solutions

#### Parcel Caching Issues

When making changes to JavaScript files that are directly included in HTML (not imported via ES modules), you may encounter issues with Parcel's caching mechanism. Changes to these files might not be reflected in the browser even when using the development server with hot reloading.

If you encounter caching issues, you can manually clear Parcel's cache:

```bash
# From the client directory
npm run clean
```

## Application Development

You can develop the server application from **Windows only**. This has only been tested on Windows 10/11.

```

### Setup

1. Install Azure Kinect SDK and Node-Gyp

   **You will need to have the official Azure Kinect SDK and node-gyp and its dependencies installed before you can continue.**

   Install the [Azure Kinect SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/sensor-sdk-download).

   Install node-gyp globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g node-gyp
   ```

   Install Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop Development with C++ Workload" selected.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy body tracking models into application folder

   In order for the body tracking for Azure Kinect to work, you will need to have several DLL files in the root of your application. The install script of the kinect-azure module tries to copy these files automatically. You should have the following files in your application root after running npm install:

   - onnxruntime.dll
   - dnn_model_2_0.onnx
   - cublas64_100.dll
   - cudart64_100.dll
   - vcomp140.dll
   - cudnn64_7.dll

   If you can't find these files, copy them from inside node_modules/kinect-azure to the kinectron/app folder.

4. Run the electron application:

   ```bash
   cd app
   npm start
   ```

### Stream Implementation Pattern

When implementing a new stream or modifying an existing one, follow this pattern:

1. **Server-Side Processor**: Create or modify a processor in `app/main/processors/` that extends `BaseFrameProcessor`
2. **Server-Side Handler**: Create or modify a handler in `app/main/handlers/` that extends `BaseStreamHandler`
3. **Client-Side API**: Add or update methods in `client/src/kinectron-modern.js`
4. **Client-Side Handler**: Add or update handlers in `client/src/streams/streamHandlers.js`
5. **Testing**: Test the stream in the streamTest example

### Debugging System

Kinectron includes a comprehensive debugging system with flag-based controls:

1. **Debug Flags**: Located in `app/main/utils/debug.js` and `client/src/utils/debug.js`
2. **Categories**: FRAMES, UI, PEER, PERFORMANCE, DATA, NETWORK, HANDLERS
3. **Usage**:
   - Enable all: `DEBUG.enableAll()`
   - Enable specific: `DEBUG.FRAMES = true`
   - Log with category: `log.frame('Frame received')`

### Error Handling and Notification System

The application includes a robust notification system for error handling:

1. **NotificationManager**: Singleton class in `app/renderer/js/utils/notificationManager.js`
2. **Modal Dialogs**: Used for displaying error messages and troubleshooting steps
3. **Console Fallback**: Falls back to console notifications when the modal can't be shown

### Building a Release

To create a packaged application:

```bash
cd app
npm run package
```

This will create an application for the platform and architecture of the computer you are working on. To learn more about packaging options, read the [Electron Packager documentation](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).

## Code Style and Conventions

1. **Modern JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features (classes, arrow functions, async/await)
2. **JSDoc Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public methods and interfaces
3. **Consistent Naming**: Follow existing naming conventions
4. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling with try/catch blocks
5. **Logging**: Use the debug logging system instead of direct console.log calls

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the repository
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch for your feature or bugfix
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following the code style guidelines
4. **Test**: Test your changes thoroughly
5. **Submit PR**: Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Troubleshooting Common Development Issues

### Application Won't Start

1. Check that all required DLL files are in the app folder
2. Verify that the Azure Kinect SDK is installed
3. Check that no other application is using the Kinect
4. Look for error messages in the console

### Stream Not Working

1. Check that the Kinect is properly initialized
2. Verify that the stream handler is registered correctly
3. Check for data structure mismatches between server and client
4. Enable debug logs to see detailed information

### Client Connection Issues

1. Check that the server is running
2. Verify that the client is using the correct IP address or Ngrok URL
3. Check for firewall issues
4. Enable PEER debug logs to see connection details
