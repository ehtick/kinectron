## Current Focus: Application to Client Streaming

We're currently working on implementing the streaming functionality from the application to the client. The color and depth streams are fully implemented, and we're now working on the raw depth stream implementation.

### Current Status

1. **UI Integration**:

   - All streams accessible from the application UI

2. **Stream Implementation**:
   - Color stream fully implemented
   - Depth stream fully implemented
   - Raw depth stream partially implemented:
     - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
     - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
     - Hardware-to-client data flow needs implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Raw Depth Stream Implementation**:

   - Implement hardware-to-client data flow for raw depth stream
   - Focus on processing of raw depth information
   - Implement client-side visualization for raw depth data

2. **Streaming Optimization**:

   - Optimize data transmission between application and client
   - Reduce latency in stream delivery
   - Improve compression for better performance

3. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Validate data integrity across the streaming pipeline

## Active Decisions

- Using a consistent approach for all data streams:

  1. Process data into image-compatible format
  2. Use Sharp for image compression and conversion
  3. Transmit data as dataURLs
  4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

- Focusing on completing all stream types before moving to additional features
- Prioritizing performance and reliability in the streaming pipeline
