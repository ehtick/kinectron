## Current Focus: Application to Client Streaming

We're currently working on implementing the streaming functionality from the application to the client. The color and depth streams are fully implemented, and we're now working on the raw depth stream implementation.

### Current Status

1. **UI Integration**:

   - All streams accessible from the application UI

2. **Stream Implementation**:
   - Color stream fully implemented
   - Depth stream fully implemented
   - Raw depth stream partially implemented:
     - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
     - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
     - Hardware-to-client data flow successfully implemented with data packing solution
     - Client-side processing for point cloud visualization still needed

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Raw Depth Stream Implementation**:

   - Implement client-side processing for point cloud visualization of raw depth data
   - Extract 16-bit depth values from the unpacked data
   - Integrate with point cloud visualization code

2. **Streaming Optimization**:

   - Optimize data transmission between application and client
   - Reduce latency in stream delivery
   - Improve compression for better performance

3. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Verify that depth values are correctly extracted and passed to visualization
   - Ensure the point cloud visualization renders properly

## Active Decisions

- Using a consistent approach for all data streams:

  1. Process data into image-compatible format
  2. Use Sharp for image compression and conversion
  3. Transmit data as dataURLs
  4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

- Implementing data packing for raw depth stream:

  1. Pack two 16-bit depth values into each RGBA pixel (using all 4 channels)
  2. Reduce message size by approximately 50% while preserving all depth data
  3. Include metadata to indicate packed format for client-side unpacking

- Focusing on completing all stream types before moving to additional features
- Prioritizing performance and reliability in the streaming pipeline
