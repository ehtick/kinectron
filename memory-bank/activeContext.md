## Current Focus: Raw Depth Processing and Visualization

We're currently working on implementing the raw depth stream processing and visualization. The color and depth streams are fully implemented, and we've made significant progress on the raw depth stream implementation but are facing some challenges with the visualization quality.

### Current Status

1. **UI Integration**:

   - All streams accessible from the application UI

2. **Stream Implementation**:
   - Color stream fully implemented
   - Depth stream fully implemented
   - Raw depth stream partially implemented:
     - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
     - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
     - Hardware-to-client data flow successfully implemented with data packing solution
     - Client-side unpacking of raw depth data implemented
     - Basic point cloud visualization implemented
     - Facing issues with depth value quantization/banding in visualization

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Raw Depth Visualization Issues**:

   - Investigate the unpacking process more deeply
   - Add more detailed logging of the raw packed data
   - Verify the bit manipulation in the unpacking process
   - Check if there's any loss of precision during the packing/unpacking process

2. **Explore Alternative Visualization Approaches**:

   - Try different rendering techniques for the point cloud
   - Experiment with mesh-based visualization instead of points
   - Consider applying smoothing or interpolation to the depth data

3. **Check Server-side Packing Implementation**:

   - Review how the depth values are being packed on the server
   - Ensure no precision is lost during the packing process
   - Consider alternative packing strategies if needed

4. **Streaming Optimization**:

   - Optimize data transmission between application and client
   - Reduce latency in stream delivery
   - Improve compression for better performance

## Active Decisions

- Using a consistent approach for all data streams:

  1. Process data into image-compatible format
  2. Use Sharp for image compression and conversion
  3. Transmit data as dataURLs
  4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

- Implementing data packing for raw depth stream:

  1. Pack two 16-bit depth values into each RGBA pixel (using all 4 channels)
  2. Reduce message size by approximately 50% while preserving all depth data
  3. Include metadata to indicate packed format for client-side unpacking

- Using Three.js for point cloud visualization:

  1. Create a point cloud representation of the depth values
  2. Implement color mapping based on depth values
  3. Add detailed depth statistics and analysis tools

- Focusing on completing all stream types before moving to additional features
- Prioritizing performance and reliability in the streaming pipeline
