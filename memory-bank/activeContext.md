# Active Context

## Current Focus: MVP Launch Preparation for Version 1.0.0

We've completed all stream implementations including color, depth, raw depth, skeleton, key, RGBD, and depth key. All streams are working correctly in both the application and client API. We've implemented a robust notification system for error handling and improved the user experience when the Kinect device isn't connected. We've also implemented a comprehensive logging system that puts all debug logs behind flags while keeping essential logs visible. We've now extended this logging system to the client-side code, ensuring consistent logging behavior across the entire application. We've further improved the skeleton stream by fixing excessive console logging in the example code. We've implemented the "Block API Calls" button functionality to enhance security by allowing users to prevent clients from controlling the Kinect while still allowing streaming data. We're now finalizing version 1.0.0 of the client API, which represents a clean break from the legacy code with a modern, streamlined implementation.

With all core features implemented and thoroughly tested, we're now ready for the MVP launch. We've updated the README.md to reflect the current state of the project and to highlight that it's ready for launch. Our focus continues to be on enhancing visualizations, improving error handling, and addressing technical debt such as inconsistent naming conventions.

## Active Decisions

- **Improving example code logging**:

  1. Identified issue with excessive console logging in skeleton stream example code
  2. Found that debug flags were being automatically enabled in kinectController.js
  3. Removed automatic enabling of DEBUG.DATA flag in stream start methods
  4. Cleaned up verbose logging in p5Visualizer.js and visualizationController.js
  5. Ensured all debug logs are properly behind appropriate debug flags
  6. Made logs conditional on both DEBUG.DATA and DEBUG.FRAMES flags for detailed joint position logs
  7. Improved example code readability and reduced console noise

- **Handling data structure mismatches in stream handlers**:

  1. Identified critical issue where data structures don't match between event producers and consumers
  2. In bodyFrame handler, data was nested as `{data: {bodies: [...]}}` but handler expected `{bodies: [...]}`
  3. Fixed by extracting nested data with `const bodyData = eventData.data`
  4. Standardized approach across all stream handlers to handle both `imageData` and `imagedata` formats
  5. Added proper logging to prevent similar issues in the future

- **Using a consistent approach for all data streams**:

  1. Process data into image-compatible format
  2. Use Sharp for image compression and conversion
  3. Transmit data as dataURLs
  4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

- **Implementing data packing for raw depth stream**:

  1. Pack one 16-bit depth value into each RGBA pixel (using R and G channels)
  2. Include metadata to indicate packed format for client-side unpacking

- **Using Three.js for point cloud visualization**:

  1. Create a point cloud representation of the depth values
  2. Implement color mapping based on depth values
  3. Add detailed depth statistics and analysis tools

- **Implementing a structured debugging system**:

  1. Flag-based approach with master and category-specific flags
  2. UI controls for toggling debug modes
  3. Console organization with console.group() for related logs
  4. Essential vs. non-essential message differentiation

- **Addressing build system challenges**:

  1. Use clean script to prevent Parcel caching issues
  2. Document development workflows for consistent results
  3. Implement proper UI state management for stream buttons
  4. Handle ES module imports in classic scripts by exposing objects globally
  5. Use window.log instead of direct imports to maintain compatibility with Parcel bundling

- **Implementing clear separation between core API and examples**:

  1. Core client API in `src/`, examples in `examples/` directory
  2. Improved maintainability through clearer project structure

- **Robust stream initialization pattern**:

  1. Follow a more sequential and predictable flow for starting streams
  2. Ensure proper cleanup of previous sessions before starting new ones
  3. Improve error handling and state management
  4. Use a simpler approach based on the legacy code pattern
  5. Add detailed logging at each step of the initialization process
  6. Implement proper resource cleanup on stream stop

- **Addressing naming convention inconsistencies**:

  1. Identified critical issue where naming conventions don't match between server and client
  2. For depth key stream, server was using 'depthKey' but client expected 'depth-key'
  3. Fixed by updating server to use 'depth-key' consistently
  4. Recognized need for systematic approach to naming conventions
  5. Added to known issues and future work for comprehensive resolution

- **Implementing a robust notification system**:

  1. Created a reusable NotificationManager class using the singleton pattern
  2. Implemented DOM-aware initialization that works regardless of when the code runs
  3. Added fallback to console notifications when the modal can't be shown
  4. Used setTimeout to ensure the DOM is ready before showing notifications
  5. Kept the "Open Kinect" button active even when initialization fails for better UX
  6. Added clear troubleshooting steps for users when the Kinect device isn't connected
  7. Ensured consistent error handling between direct and peer-to-peer initialization paths

- **Implementing robust refresh handling**:

  1. Identified issue where Ctrl+R refresh didn't properly clean up IPC handlers
  2. Implemented comprehensive cleanup in StreamManager to remove all stream-specific handlers
  3. Added special handling for 'start-body-tracking' which follows a different naming pattern
  4. Modified the main process to properly sequence cleanup operations during refresh
  5. Ensured proper reinitialization of resources after renderer reload

- **Fixing NgrokClientState transition error**:

  1. Identified error in stream test example: "Invalid state transition from connected to connected"
  2. Root cause was NgrokClientState not allowing self-transitions from 'connected' to 'connected'
  3. Modified NgrokClientState.VALID_TRANSITIONS to allow self-transition for the 'connected' state
  4. Added a comment in peerConnection.js to explain the purpose of allowing self-transitions
  5. Documented the state machine pattern in systemPatterns.md for future reference
  6. This fix allows multiple data channels to open on the same connection without errors

- **Implementing frame dropping and buffering strategy**:

  1. Verified that all stream handlers use lossy transmission by default
  2. Confirmed that each stream handler passes `lossy=true` to the `broadcastFrame` method
  3. Validated buffer checking mechanism in PeerConnectionManager that prevents buffer bloat
  4. Documented the frame dropping strategy in systemPatterns.md
  5. Made all streams lossy by default to prioritize real-time performance over complete data
  6. This approach maintains real-time performance even on slower networks
  7. Prioritizes fresh data over complete data, which is critical for interactive applications

- **Removing legacy API from client implementation**:

  4. Updated import paths and removed code that attached to the window object
  5. Simplified exports to only include the modern API components
  6. This change supports our version 1.0.0 release as a clean break from legacy code
  7. Benefits include reduced bundle size, simplified maintenance, and a cleaner API

- **Updating examples to modern API**:

  1. Removed legacy API references from client examples
  2. Updated import paths from 'kinectron-modern.js' to 'kinectron.js'
  3. Removed "Legacy Interface Test" section from test example
  4. Verified all examples work with the modern API

- **Refining API exports for cleaner interface**:
  1. Identified that the API was exporting implementation details (PeerConnection, DEFAULT_PEER_CONFIG, DEFAULT_PEER_ID)
  2. Simplified exports to only include the Kinectron class as both named and default export
  3. Updated example files to use the new API structure
  4. This change improves encapsulation, creates a more intuitive API, and follows modern JavaScript best practices
  5. Benefits include cleaner imports for users and more flexibility for future internal changes

## API Modernization Plan

We've created a roadmap for modernizing the Kinectron API for public release. The plan is broken into five manageable phases:

1. **Build System Modernization**: Implementing Rollup for multi-format builds (ESM, CJS, UMD)
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Adding JSDoc comments and creating usage guides
3. **NPM Publishing Setup**: Configuring for proper NPM publishing
4. **CDN Distribution**: Setting up for CDN access via jsDelivr and unpkg
5. **Update Project Documentation**: Ensuring README and CONTRIBUTE files are accurate

The detailed roadmap is available in ROADMAP.md in the project root.

**Important Note**: The current project documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTE.md) is out of date and should not be used as a reference until updated in Phase 5.

### Current Progress

- ✅ API exports have been simplified to only expose the Kinectron class
- ✅ Examples have been reorganized to the root level
- ✅ Testing tools have been moved to client/tools/
