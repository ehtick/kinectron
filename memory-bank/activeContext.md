## Current Focus: Application to Client Streaming

We're currently working on implementing the streaming functionality from the application to the client. The color and depth streams are working correctly from client, and our next task is to implement the raw depth stream.

### Current Status

1. **UI Integration**:

   - All streams accessible from the application UI

2. **Stream Implementation**:
   - Color stream fully implemented
   - Depth stream fully implemented
   - Raw depth stream planned for next implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Raw Depth Stream Implementation**:

   - Implement RawDepthFrameProcessor
   - Implement RawDepthStreamHandler
   - Add client-side processing for raw depth data
   - Ensure proper visualization in client applications

2. **Streaming Optimization**:

   - Optimize data transmission between application and client
   - Reduce latency in stream delivery
   - Improve compression for better performance

3. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Validate data integrity across the streaming pipeline

## Active Decisions

- Using a consistent approach for all data streams:

  1. Process data into image-compatible format
  2. Use Sharp for image compression and conversion
  3. Transmit data as dataURLs
  4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

- Focusing on completing all stream types before moving to additional features
- Prioritizing performance and reliability in the streaming pipeline
