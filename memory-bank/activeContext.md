# Active Context

## Current Focus: Version 1.0.0 Release

We've completed all stream implementations and thoroughly tested them. Version 1.0.0 has been released with all core features implemented. The client library has been published to npm, and the application released via GitHub releases.

### Current Status

1. **Documentation**:

   - Documentation for Version 1.0.0 release is complete
   - README.md and CONTRIBUTE.md updated for the 1.0.0 release
   - CHANGELOG.md created to track version changes
   - ROADMAP.md updated with the 1.0.0 release plan

2. **Streams**:

   - All streams fully implemented and working correctly:
     - Color stream
     - Depth stream
     - Raw depth stream
     - Skeleton feed
     - Key stream
     - RGBD stream
     - Depth key stream

3. **Features**:
   - Comprehensive debugging system with flag-based controls
   - Robust notification system for error handling
   - "Block API Calls" button functionality for enhanced security

### Next Steps

- **Resolve application packaging issue**

  - Electron packager fails within monorepo structure
  - Current workaround is to move application into a separate disconnected folder for packaging

- **Future Enhancements**
  - Add recording functionality
  - Address technical debt around naming conventions
  - Enhance point cloud visualization quality
  - Implement additional educational examples using p5.js and Three.js

## Active Decisions

- **Addressing naming convention inconsistencies**:

  - Identified critical issue where naming conventions don't match between server and client
  - For depth key stream, server was using 'depthKey' but client expected 'depth-key'
  - Fixed by updating server to use 'depth-key' consistently
  - Need systematic approach to naming conventions in future work

- **Frame dropping and buffering strategy**:

  - All streams use lossy transmission by default
  - Frames are dropped when the network can't keep up
  - Buffer checking prevents buffer bloat and reduces latency
  - Prioritizes fresh data over complete data for real-time performance

- **API export refinement**:
  - Simplified exports to only include the Kinectron class as default export
  - Improved encapsulation and created more intuitive API
  - Follows modern JavaScript best practices for library exports
