# Progress

## What Works

- Peer-to-peer connection between server and client
- Color stream visualization
- Depth stream visualization (processed depth images)
- Body tracking
- Key (green screen) functionality
- RGBD (color + depth) visualization
- Raw depth data transmission from hardware to client

## Completed Features

### UI Integration for Streams

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: All available streams accessible from application UI buttons
- **Current Behavior**: Users can activate streams directly from the application interface
- **Streams Available**: Color, Depth, Raw Depth, Body, Key, RGBD

### Color Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits color data; client receives and visualizes

### Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits depth data; client receives and visualizes

## Partially Completed Features

### Raw Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Partially completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
  - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
  - Hardware-to-client data flow successfully implemented with data packing solution
  - Implemented data packing to reduce message size by ~50% while preserving all depth data
  - Added metadata to indicate packed format for client-side unpacking
  - Successfully transmitting raw depth data from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Users can start the raw depth stream from the client, which activates the Kinect hardware
  - Raw depth data is successfully transmitted from hardware to client
- **Remaining Work**:
  - Implement client-side processing for point cloud visualization
  - Extract 16-bit depth values from the unpacked data
  - Integrate with point cloud visualization code

## Known Issues

No critical issues currently with implemented streams.

## Future Work

1. **Complete Raw Depth Stream Implementation**:
   - Implement client-side processing for point cloud visualization
   - Integrate with point cloud visualization code
