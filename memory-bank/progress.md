# Progress

## What Works

- Peer-to-peer connection between server and client
- Color stream visualization
- Depth stream visualization (processed depth images)
- Body tracking
- Key (green screen) functionality
- RGBD (color + depth) visualization
- Raw depth data transmission from hardware to client
- Raw depth data unpacking on client side
- Basic point cloud visualization of raw depth data

## Completed Features

### UI Integration for Streams

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: All available streams accessible from application UI buttons
- **Current Behavior**: Users can activate streams directly from the application interface
- **Streams Available**: Color, Depth, Raw Depth, Body, Key, RGBD

### Color Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits color data; client receives and visualizes

### Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits depth data; client receives and visualizes

### Raw Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed with one remaining issue
- **Implementation**:
  - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
  - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
  - Hardware-to-client data flow successfully implemented with data packing solution
  - Successfully switched from putting two depth values into a 4-channel pixel to only putting one depth value per four channels
  - Added metadata to indicate packed format for client-side unpacking
  - Successfully transmitting raw depth data from hardware to client
  - Implemented client-side unpacking of raw depth data
  - Created `_unpackRawDepthData` method in `kinectron-modern.js`
  - Implemented Three.js-based point cloud visualization
  - Added depth value analysis and statistics
  - Added test utilities for verifying packing/unpacking correctness
  - Confirmed that the packing/unpacking algorithm works correctly on both server and client sides
  - Switched from lossy to lossless WebP compression to preserve depth precision
  - Added size logging to monitor message sizes
  - Implemented flag-controlled test value system for debugging
  - Resolved "Message too big for JSON channel" errors by changing PeerJS serialization method from JSON to binary
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Users can start the raw depth stream from the client, which activates the Kinect hardware
  - Raw depth data is successfully transmitted from hardware to client
  - Client unpacks the raw depth data into 16-bit depth values correctly
  - Basic point cloud visualization is displayed
  - The "Stop Stream" button in streamTest.html stops the stream in the UI but doesn't stop the stream on the server side

## Known Issues

1. **Raw Depth Stream Stop Button Issue**:

   - **Issue**: The "Stop Stream" button in streamTest.html doesn't fully stop the raw depth stream
   - **Symptoms**:
     - UI updates correctly to show the stream has stopped
     - Server continues processing and broadcasting data
   - **Current Status**: Need to implement proper cleanup similar to app.js
   - **Next Steps**: Fix the "Stop Stream" button to properly stop the stream on the server side

2. **Raw Depth Visualization Quality**:

   - **Issue**: Depth data appears in distinct planes rather than smooth contours
   - **Symptoms**: Banding/quantization effect in the point cloud visualization
   - **Attempted Fixes**:
     - Removed scaling operations that could reduce precision
     - Implemented more sophisticated color mapping
     - Added detailed depth statistics and analysis tools
     - Improved camera positioning and controls
   - **Current Status**: Visualization quality can be improved now that data integrity issues are resolved
   - **Next Steps**: Enhance visualization techniques for better quality

## Future Work

1. **Fix the "Stop Stream" Button**:

   - Implement proper cleanup for the raw depth stream in streamTest.html
   - Compare with the working implementation in app.js

2. **Enhance Raw Depth Visualization**:
   - Improve point cloud visualization quality
   - Explore alternative visualization techniques if needed
