### Frame Dropping and Buffering Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**:
  - Verified that all stream handlers use lossy transmission by default:
    - Each stream handler passes `lossy=true` to the `broadcastFrame` method
    - This enables frame dropping when the network can't keep up
  - Confirmed buffer checking mechanism in PeerConnectionManager:
    - Before sending a frame, the system checks if there's data in the buffer
    - If the buffer is not empty and the stream is marked as lossy, the frame is dropped
    - This prevents buffer bloat and reduces latency
  - Documented the frame dropping strategy in systemPatterns.md:
    - Added a new section explaining the buffering and frame dropping mechanism
    - Included code examples and benefits of this approach
  - Made all streams lossy by default to prioritize real-time performance
- **Current Behavior**:
  - All streams automatically drop frames when the network can't keep up
  - Real-time performance is maintained even on slower networks
  - Fresh data is prioritized over complete data
  - Latency is reduced by preventing buffer bloat
  - Particularly important for streams like depth, color, and body tracking where real-time feedback is critical

   - **Symptoms**:
     - Stream handlers fail to process data correctly
     - "No handler found for event" errors
     - Data not being properly visualized
   - **Solution**:
     - Implemented workarounds for specific streams
     - Added normalization code to handle both formats for backward compatibility
   - **Current Status**: Working with current solutions, but needs a systematic approach

     - Standardize on a single naming pattern (either hyphenated or camelCase)
     - Create a comprehensive refactoring plan to implement consistent naming

6. **Unpacking Issues in Client Handlers**:

   - **Issue**: Raw data unpacking can be error-prone if not handled consistently
   - **Symptoms**: Incorrect depth values or visualization artifacts
   - **Solution**: Implemented robust unpacking methods with validation
   - **Current Status**: Working correctly but requires careful implementation for each stream type
   - **Next Steps**: Consider creating a unified unpacking utility for all stream types
