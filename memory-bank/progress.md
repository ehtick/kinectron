## Known Issues

1. **Raw Depth Visualization Quality**:

   - **Issue**: Depth data appears in distinct planes rather than smooth contours
   - **Status**: Working but can be improved
   - **Next Steps**: Enhance visualization techniques for better quality

2. **Data Structure and Naming Convention Inconsistencies**:

   - **Issue**: Inconsistent naming between server and client (e.g., imageData vs. imagedata)
   - **Status**: Working with current workarounds
   - **Next Steps**: Standardize on a single naming pattern (either hyphenated or camelCase)

3. **Parcel Build System Caching**:
   - **Issue**: Caching issues with directly included JavaScript files
   - **Status**: Resolved with clean script workaround
   - **Next Steps**: Document development workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Release Tasks

1. Publish client library to npm
2. Create GitHub release with packaged application
3. Include release notes from CHANGELOG.md
4. Announce release on relevant platforms

### Future Enhancements

1. **Technical Debt**:

   - Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
   - Create unified initialization and unpacking utilities

2. **Visualization Improvements**:

   - Enhance point cloud visualization quality

3. **Advanced Features**:

   - Recording and playback of skeleton data

4. **Educational Examples**:
   - Implement p5.js examples
   - Implement Three.js examples
