# Progress

## What Works

- Peer-to-peer connection between server and client
- Color stream visualization
- Depth stream visualization (processed depth images)
- Body tracking
- Key (green screen) functionality
- RGBD (color + depth) visualization

## Completed Features

### UI Integration for Streams

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: All available streams accessible from application UI buttons
- **Current Behavior**: Users can activate streams directly from the application interface
- **Streams Available**: Color, Depth, Raw Depth, Body, Key, RGBD

### Color Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits color data; client receives and visualizes

### Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Completed and working correctly
- **Implementation**: Full pipeline from hardware to client
- **Current Behavior**: Server captures, processes, and transmits depth data; client receives and visualizes

## Partially Completed Features

### Raw Depth Stream Implementation

- **Status**: Partially completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Client-to-hardware data flow working (client requests properly activate the Kinect)
  - Raw depth image is properly displayed in the application UI
  - Fixed issues with Kinect hardware initialization for raw depth
  - Fixed issues with client requests activating the Kinect hardware
- **Current Behavior**: Users can start the raw depth stream from the client, which activates the Kinect hardware
- **Remaining Work**: Complete hardware-to-client data flow, implement client-side processing and visualization

## Known Issues

No critical issues currently with implemented streams.

## Future Work

1. **Complete Raw Depth Stream Implementation**:

   - Implement hardware-to-client data flow
   - Implement client-side processing of raw depth data
   - Add visualization options for raw depth data
